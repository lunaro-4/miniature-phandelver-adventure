## Personality

Generally chaotic-evil

> Orcs had poor temperaments and were given to anger more easily than some races. Easily offended and impatient, orcs generally preferred violent solutions and rarely considered multiple ways of approaching a problem. However, in spite of this, many orcs were excellent at getting results, since they were creatures of action, not thought. Some exceptions to this profile did exist, however, such as the famed King Obould.[11](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orc#cite_note-FRPG-p20-11)
